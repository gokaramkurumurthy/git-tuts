This project is about building Nicheflare, a content subscription website where people can access exclusive, 
high-quality content by subscribing. The platform will focus on specialized topics like gourmet cooking, 
DIY projects, and sustainable living.

What does the platform offer?

Subscribers can read articles, watch videos, and join live webinars.
Content Creators (Curators) can publish high-quality content using a built-in editor.
Admins manage users, payments, and content moderation.
Monetization through subscriptions, premium webinars, and sponsored content. 
 
Step 1: Project Planning & Research

Define Core Features – User roles, subscription model, content types, payments, security, content discovery, and community features.
Choose Technology Stack – Select frontend, backend, database, authentication, payment gateway, and hosting services.
Design Database Structure – Plan tables for users, content, payments, and subscriptions.
UI/UX Wireframing – Create mockups for landing page, dashboard, curator panel, and admin panel.

Step 2: Frontend Development

Set Up the Project – Configure React/Next.js and install necessary dependencies.
Implement Routing – Set up pages for Home, Dashboard, Content, Curator Panel, and Admin Panel.
Build UI Components – Header, Navigation, Subscription Plans, Content Display, User Dashboard, Curator Panel, and Admin Dashboard.
Ensure Responsive Design – Optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Step 3: Backend Development

Set Up Backend Server – Configure Node.js/Express.js and connect to PostgreSQL.
Implement User Authentication – Register, login, password encryption, JWT authentication.
Develop Content Management APIs – CRUD operations for content (create, update, delete, fetch).
Implement Subscription & Payment APIs – Integrate Stripe for handling user subscriptions.
Add Role-Based Access Control – Restrict access for users, curators, and admins.

Step 4: Connecting Frontend & Backend

Integrate API Calls – Use Axios or Fetch API to connect frontend with backend services.
Handle Authentication in Frontend – Implement JWT-based authentication and protect routes.
Manage User Roles – Different UI for users, curators, and admins.

Step 5: Payment Integration

Configure Payment Gateway – Set up Stripe for handling transactions.
Implement Subscription Flow – Payment processing, subscription activation, and renewal.
Update Subscription Status in Database – Store user subscription details and access levels.

Step 6: Testing & Debugging

Test API Endpoints – Ensure all backend services work correctly.
Check UI/UX Flow – Ensure smooth navigation and user experience.
Fix Security Issues – Validate inputs, encrypt sensitive data, and handle errors properly.

Step 7: Deployment & Launch

Deploy Frontend – Host on Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy Backend – Host on AWS, DigitalOcean, or similar platforms.
Deploy Database – Use AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) or a cloud-hosted database.
Set Up Monitoring & Analytics – Track user behavior and system performance.

Step 8: Post-Launch & Maintenance

Collect User Feedback – Improve features based on user input.
Optimize Performance – Improve loading speeds and backend efficiency.
Add New Features – Expand content types, add forums, and enhance recommendations.
Run Marketing Campaigns – SEO, social media promotions, and paid advertising.
